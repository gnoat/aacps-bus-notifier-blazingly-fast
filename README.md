# AACPS Sucks
System to check AACPS bus issues and notify relevant parents of issues

AACPS currently doesn't notify individuals, it's your responsibility to check their website 10 times a day to see if there's going to be a bus running or not.  This fixes that by checking the schedule for you and notifying you if your child's bus route is on the table.

This is a rewrite in Rust (from Python) of my repository [here](https://github.com/oafmilk/aacps-bus-notifications).  Just trying to get my Rust skillz up.
